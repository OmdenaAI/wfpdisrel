Another 135 fatalities were confirmed in Sogod.[29] More than 100 persons were injured by falling coconuts and other airborne debris.[30] On Leyte alone, damage was estimated at $8 million.[24] The Red Cross estimated over a thousand homes in 41 towns on Panay were destroyed by the storm.[31] More than 20 percent of crops and infrastructure were destroyed.[32] Four people were killed on the island.[22] Upon looping in the South China Sea, Amy brought torrential rainfall to areas of Manila, though no damage was reported.[33]\n",
