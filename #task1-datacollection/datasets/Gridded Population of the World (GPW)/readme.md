## Gridded Population Data

### Introduction
The Gridded Population of the World (GPW) models the distribution of the human population on a continuous raster surface. Since the release of the first version of this global population grid in 1995, the essential inputs to GPW have been population census tables and administrative boundaries. The purpose of GPW is to provide a spatially-disaggregated population layer that is compatible with data sets from social, economic, and Earth science disciplines, and remote sensing data. It provides globally consistent and spatially explicit data for use in research, policy-making, and communications
