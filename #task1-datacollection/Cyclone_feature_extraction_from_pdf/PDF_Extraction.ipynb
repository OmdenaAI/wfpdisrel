In the U.S. , there were no direct deaths due to Allison . Damage was greatest in the coastal sections of Dixie , Levy , Taylor and Wakulla counties , mainly from storm surge effects , with 60 houses and businesses damaged . A house collapsed at Bald Point in Franklin County . About 5000 people evacuated from the coast . Other coastal effects included mostly minor beach erosion , damage to sea walls and coastal roadways , and the sinking of several small boats . Otherwise , minor wind damage to roofs , signs , power lines and trees occurred over most of the north Florida peninsula . Some relatively minor crop damage was also reported . Total damage in Florida is estimated at $ 860,000 , and the tornado near St. Marys , Georgia , caused about $ 800,000 in damage , bringing Allison ’ s overall U.S. damage figure to $ 1.7 million . d.

At Barbuda , where a full Category 4 hurricane was experienced , the damage to structures was estimated at 70 percent along with severe flooding and erosion . The estimate for St. Maartin and St. Martin is 60 percent damage from a Category 2 or 3 hurricane . The prime minister of Antigua was quoted as saying that nearly half the homes on that island were destroyed .

U.S. Coast Guard , a C-130 reconnaissance plane investigating Roxanne and Mexican helicopters searched for people missing from a petroleum work-barge that sank with 245 people on board . Five of these 14 deaths appear to be related to this event including one American . According to Mexican authorities , more than 40,000 homes were damaged by Roxanne in the States of Campeche , Quintana Roo , Tabasco Veracruz and Yucatan . Numerous crops were damaged , cattle drowned and roads were washed out or blocked by mud and rock slides . The road between the City of Carmen and Campeche was completely destroyed . Thousands of people were evacuated . There are unconfirmed reports that many hotel lobbies in Cancun and Cozumel were damaged from pounding waves . Extensive tree damage was observed in Cozumel . Storm tides and swollen rivers caused the worst flooding in Campeche and Tabasco since 1927 . It appears the worst damage was produced by the pounding of 15 to 20 foot waves along the shore for several days . The waters from the Gulf of Mexico surged hundred of yards inland . This area had previously been affected by Hurricane Opal a week or two before and it is difficult to separate the damage caused by Opal and Roxanne .

Marilyn caused severe damage to the U.S. Virgin Islands , in particular to St. Thomas . An estimated 80 percent of the homes and businesses on St. Thomas were destroyed and at least 10,000 people were left homeless . Some of the damage was reportedly attributable to lax construction standards and practices . According to FEMA , 30 percent of the homes on St. John were destroyed and 60 percent were roofless . About 20 to 30 percent of homes in St. Croix received damage . Trees fell and hotel windows broke there . Hillsides were littered with sheets of metal roofing , wooden planks and household debris . On Culebra , 250 homes were destroyed or severely damaged and light planes were overturned . Large waves crashed over the harbor at Dewey , Culebra , flooding streets . Flash floods occurred over northern and eastern Puerto Rico where the La Plata and Manati rivers overflowed . The American Insurance Services Group estimated insured losses for the U. S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico at $ 875 million . Because the overall loss is often estimated to be up to about double the insured loss , the total U.S. loss is tentatively estimated at $ 1.5 billion . The U. S. Virgin Islands Bureau of Economic Research estimated the economic loss at $ 3 billion . FEMA placed the cost for their programs at $ 1 billion in the Virgin Islands and $ 50 million in Puerto Rico . The FEMA totals include losses not traditionally described by the NHC as `` damage '' , such as FEMA 's cost to set up field offices , inspector ’ s salaries , disaster unemployment compensation , and crisis counseling .

In Puerto Rico , Two died in an automobile accident and another died while surfing . On the French half of St. Martin , one person was electrocuted and one fell off a boat . The U.S. Virgin Islands , along with North Carolina , has been declared a federal disaster area . Surveys indicate that Bertha damaged almost 2500 homes on St. Thomas and St. John . For many , it was a second hit in the ten months since Hurricane Marilyn devastated the same area . It is likely that there was beach erosion on the north coast of the Dominican Republic as Bertha passed to the north . The Bahamas were also affected by the weak side of the hurricane , but there are no damage figures available from either of these locations . The primary effects in North Carolina were to the coastal counties and included storm surge flooding and beach erosion , roof damage , piers washed away , fallen trees , and damage to crops . A survey indicated over 5000 homes damaged , mostly from storm surge . A Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) estimate of the number of persons in South and North Carolina who evacuated is 750,000 . Minor wind damage and flooding also spread along the path of the storm all the way to New England . The American Insurance Association reports an estimate of $ 135 million dollars in insured property damage , primarily along coastal North Carolina .

However , the total death count will likely be revised downward in the next update of this report based on data from NWS personnel to be published in Storm Data , since the NWS attempts to list deaths directly attributable to the weather . For example , most vehicle accidents and heart attacks from over-exertion after a hurricane are not considered direct deaths . Storm surge on the North Carolina coast destroyed or seriously damaged numerous beachfront houses .

Nearly a half-million tourists and residents were ordered to evacuate the coast in North and South Carolina . Press reports from Reuters News Service stated that 4.5 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were left without power . The Property Claim Services Division of the American Insurance Services Group reports that Fran caused an estimated $ 1.6 billion dollars in insured property damage to the United States . This estimate includes $ 1.275 billion in North Carolina , $ 20 million in South Carolina , $ 175 million in Virginia , $ 50 million in Maryland , $ 20 million in West Virginia , $ 40 million in Pennsylvania and $ 20 million in Ohio . A conservative ratio between total damage and insured property damage , compared to past landfalling hurricanes , is two to one . Therefore , the total U.S. damage estimate is $ 3.2 billion . d.

            "Table 5 lists the deaths and insured damage estimates associated with Georges . The 602° direct deaths attributed to Georges make it the 19 '' deadliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin this century ( Rappaport and Partagas , 1995 ) . Most of the deaths associated with Georges ( Table 6 ) occurred in the Dominican Republic and Haiti , due mainly to flash flooding and subsequent mud slides in high terrain regions . The lone direct death in the United States , which was freshwater flood-related , occurred in Mobile , Alabama . Insured property damage estimates supplied by the Property Claims Services Division of the American Insurance Services Group estimates that Georges caused a total of $ 2.955 billion in damage in the United States including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands ( see Table 6 for individual state totals ) . These estimates exclude storm surge damage . To determine the total estimated damage , a ratio of 2:1 is applied to the insured property damage ; this is based on comparisons done in historical hurricanes . Thus , the total estimated damage from Georges is $ 5.9 billion . Note - in 2011 the U.S. damage estimate ( including Puerto Rico and the U.S.V.I . ) was revised to $ 6.365 billion . * - This represents the best estimate received to-date and is subject to later revision . Totals which appear in Table 6 from the Dominican Republic and Haiti are government-based estimates as reported in media accounts . In Puerto Rico , there was considerable damage to homes throughout the island . A total of 72,605 homes were damaged , of which 28,005 are estimated to have been completely destroyed . During the hurricane , over 26,000 people were in shelters . In the Dominican Republic upwards of 185,000 were left homeless by Georges and 100,000 remained in shelters through mid-October as electricity and water service remain out in most of the country . Across Haiti , government officials stated that 167,332 had been left homeless by the hurricane . The agricultural industry in Puerto Rico was hit hard by Georges with estimates of 95 % of the plantain and banana crop destroyed along with 75 % of the coffee crop . Despite Georges ’ weakened state when it moved across Cuba , it had a substantial impact . A total of 60 , 475 homes were damaged of which 3,481 were completely destroyed . As was the case in Puerto Rico , the agricultural sector was hard hit with major losses at banana plantations in eastern Cuba . The damage to dwellings in the United States was not as extensive as that experienced across the Caribbean . In the Florida Keys 1536 homes were damaged of which 173 were completely destroyed , many of which were mobile homes . Some roof and structural damage was also reported along the coast of Mississippi . In the first 60 days or so after Georges made its final landfall in Mississippi , the American Red Cross spent $ 104 million on relief services in the United States Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico , Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi , the Florida Keys and the Florida Panhandle . This makes it the most expensive disaster aid effort in the organization ’ s 117-year history . d. Forecast and Warning\n",

The total consists of four people including two toddlers whose pickup was swept away by rising water in Real County on the 23rd . Seven other people from the truck were rescued . Nine deaths due to drowning occurred in Del Rio ( Val Verde County ) along the San Felipe Creek during the late night of 23 August . Some in the latter group could have expired after the system was no longer classified as a tropical cyclone . Emergency operations personnel in Mexico reported that as of early October the number of fatalities in Ciudad Acufia , Mexico , across the border from Del Rio , was seven . Media reports indicate that three of these victims drowned while trying to cross a flooded gully . A preliminary estimate of the total loss due to the inland flood is $ 50 million .

            "The estimated death toll from Mitch currently stands at 9,086 . Fact Sheet # 21 from the U.S. Agency for International Development , as of December 1998 , compiled the following death totals : Honduras , 5677 ; Nicaragua , 2,863 ; Guatemala , 258 ; El Salvador ; 239 ; Mexico , 9 and 7 in Costa Rica . The death toll also includes 31 fatalities associated with the schooner Fantome . In addition , another 9191 persons were listed as missing . The exact death toll will probably never be known . However , this was one of the deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclones in history , ranking below only the 1780 “ Great Hurricane ” in the lesser Antilles , and comparable to the Galveston hurricane of 1900 , and Hurricane Fifi of 1974 , the latter also striking Honduras . Mitch also claimed two lives in Monroe County , Florida . Both deaths were drowning-related incidents resulting from a fishing boat capsizing . It has been estimated that there was a 50 percent loss to Honduras ’ agricultural crops . At least 70,000 houses were damaged and more than 92 bridges were damaged or destroyed . There was severe damage to the infrastructure of Honduras and entire communities were isolated from outside assistance . To a lesser extent , damage was similar in Nicaragua , where a large mudslide inundated ten communities situated at the base of La Casitas Volcano . Guatemala and El Salvador also suffered from flash floods which destroyed thousands of homes , along with bridges and roads . The Florida tornadoes injured 65 people and damaged or destroyed 645 homes . Insured property damage supplied by the Florida insurance Council puts the insured damage estimate for Florida at $ 20 million . These estimates exclude storm surge damage . To determine the total estimated damage , a ratio of 2:1 is applied to the insured property damage ; this is based on comparisons done in historical hurricanes . Thus , the U.S. total estimated damage from Mitch is $ 40 million . d. Forecast and Warning\n",

Most of these deaths were due to drowning in freshwater flooding . Floyd was the deadliest hurricane in the United States since Agnes of 1972 . In the United States , the Property Claims Services Division of the Insurance Services Office reports that insured losses due to Floyd totaled 1.325 billion dollars . Ordinarily this figure would be doubled to estimate the total damage . However , in comparison to most hurricane landfalls , in the case of Floyd there was an inordinately large amount of freshwater flood damage , which probably alters the two to one damage ratio .
